This is simply a working example of how to integrate the Handlebars templating solution into a typical webpack workflow.

# You Need webpack First!
Make sure you have webpack installed globally on your machine.

` npm install webpack -g`

For additional help see [the official webpack site](https://webpack.github.io/).

After cloning this repo and CD'ing into the project folder be sure to run `npm install`

Then, whenever you want to bundle everything up simply run `webpack` 

Celebrate.

# Zoe planned enhancements
This enhancements are used to become familiar with webpack and are developed under feature branch webpack-dev-server. I'll use the learned knowledge of Brad Schiff's Udemy Course.

## What I still want to do
* use app.js as collection of links to modules
* use separate folder for development and production
* clear production folder on build
* use webpacks-dev-server on npm run dev
* use axios for http request

## What I already committed
* changed folder structure
* webpacks creates production folder docs on npm run build
